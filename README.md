# ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

This project was prepared with the assistance of the course [Advanced SQL: MySQL for Ecommerce Data Analysis](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-mysql-for-analytics-business-intelligence/) on Udemy.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW 

Situation :- Cindy, CEO, is on the verge of securing Maven Fuzzy Factory’s next round of funding, and she needs  help to create a compelling story for investors. I’ll need to gather the relevant data and assist her in crafting a narrative about our data-driven company and the rapid growth we’ve been achieving.

Objectives :- I extract and analyze traffic and website performance data to create a compelling growth story that the CEO can present. I dive into the marketing channel activities and website improvements that have contributed to our success so far, using this opportunity to showcase my analytical skills to investors. As an Analyst, my job begins with extracting and analyzing the data. The next equally important step is effectively communicating the story to the stakeholders.

# DATA SOURCES
This project analyzes eCommerce data using the Maven Fuzzy Factory database, which consists of six interrelated tables. The dataset includes comprehensive information on website activity, products, and orders and refunds. By leveraging MySQL, the project explores how customers access and interact with the website, evaluates landing page performance and conversion rates, and investigates product-level sales trends. The insights gained aim to provide a deeper understanding of user behavior, product performance, and refund patterns, contributing to data-driven decision-making in an eCommerce context. Please find below ER diagram of database :-

# DATA ANALYSIS

QUESTION 1 :-  First, I’d like to show our volume growth. Can you pull overall session and order volume, trended by quarter for the life of the business? Since the most recent quarter is incomplete, you can decide how to handle it.

```sql
SELECT 
	YEAR(website_sessions.created_at) AS yr,
	QUARTER(website_sessions.created_at) AS qtr, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS sessions, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) AS orders
FROM website_sessions 
	LEFT JOIN orders
		ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2
;
```
QUESTION 2 :- Next, let’s showcase all of our efficiency improvements. I would love to show quarterly figures since we launched, for session-to-order conversion rate, revenue per order, and revenue per session. 

```sql
SELECT 
	YEAR(website_sessions.created_at) AS yr,
	QUARTER(website_sessions.created_at) AS qtr, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS session_to_order_conv_rate, 
    SUM(price_usd)/COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) AS revenue_per_order, 
    SUM(price_usd)/COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS revenue_per_session
FROM website_sessions 
	LEFT JOIN orders
		ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2
;
```

QUESTION 3:- I’d like to show how we’ve grown specific channels. Could you pull a quarterly view of orders from Gsearch nonbrand, Bsearch nonbrand, brand search overall, organic search, and direct type-in?

```sql
SELECT 
	YEAR(website_sessions.created_at) AS yr,
	QUARTER(website_sessions.created_at) AS qtr, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'gsearch' AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS gsearch_nonbrand_orders, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'bsearch' AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS bsearch_nonbrand_orders, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_search_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NOT NULL THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS organic_search_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NULL THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS direct_type_in_orders
    
FROM website_sessions 
	LEFT JOIN orders
		ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2
;
```

QUESTION 4:- Next, let’s show the overall session-to-order conversion rate trends for those same channels, by quarter. Please also make a note of any periods where we made major improvements or optimizations.

```sql
SELECT 
	YEAR(website_sessions.created_at) AS yr,
	QUARTER(website_sessions.created_at) AS qtr, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'gsearch' AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END)
		/COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'gsearch' AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS gsearch_nonbrand_conv_rt, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'bsearch' AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) 
		/COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'bsearch' AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS bsearch_nonbrand_conv_rt, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) 
		/COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_search_conv_rt,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NOT NULL THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) 
		/COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NOT NULL THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS organic_search_conv_rt,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NULL THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) 
		/COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NULL THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS direct_type_in_conv_rt
FROM website_sessions 
	LEFT JOIN orders
		ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2
;
```

QUESTION 5:-We’ve come a long way since the days of selling a single product. Let’s pull monthly trending for revenue and margin by product, along with total sales and revenue. Note anything you notice about seasonality.

```sql
SELECT
	YEAR(created_at) AS yr, 
    MONTH(created_at) AS mo, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id = 1 THEN price_usd ELSE NULL END) AS mrfuzzy_rev,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id = 1 THEN price_usd - cogs_usd ELSE NULL END) AS mrfuzzy_marg,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id = 2 THEN price_usd ELSE NULL END) AS lovebear_rev,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id = 2 THEN price_usd - cogs_usd ELSE NULL END) AS lovebear_marg,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id = 3 THEN price_usd ELSE NULL END) AS birthdaybear_rev,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id = 3 THEN price_usd - cogs_usd ELSE NULL END) AS birthdaybear_marg,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id = 4 THEN price_usd ELSE NULL END) AS minibear_rev,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id = 4 THEN price_usd - cogs_usd ELSE NULL END) AS minibear_marg,
    SUM(price_usd) AS total_revenue,  
    SUM(price_usd - cogs_usd) AS total_margin
FROM order_items 
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2
;
```

QUESTION 6:- Let’s dive deeper into the impact of introducing new products. Please pull monthly sessions to the /products page, and show how the % of those sessions clicking through another page has changed over time, along with a view of how conversion from /products to placing an order has improved.

```sql
-- first, identifying all the views of the /products page
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE products_pageviews
SELECT
	website_session_id, 
    website_pageview_id, 
    created_at AS saw_product_page_at

FROM website_pageviews 
WHERE pageview_url = '/products'
;


SELECT 
	YEAR(saw_product_page_at) AS yr, 
    MONTH(saw_product_page_at) AS mo,
    COUNT(DISTINCT products_pageviews.website_session_id) AS sessions_to_product_page, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_pageviews.website_session_id) AS clicked_to_next_page, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_pageviews.website_session_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT products_pageviews.website_session_id) AS clickthrough_rt,
    COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) AS orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT products_pageviews.website_session_id) AS products_to_order_rt
FROM products_pageviews
	LEFT JOIN website_pageviews 
		ON website_pageviews.website_session_id = products_pageviews.website_session_id -- same session
        AND website_pageviews.website_pageview_id > products_pageviews.website_pageview_id -- they had another page AFTER
	LEFT JOIN orders 
		ON orders.website_session_id = products_pageviews.website_session_id
GROUP BY 1,2
;
```

QUESTION 7:-  We made our 4th product available as a primary product on December 05, 2014 (it was previously only a cross-sell item). Could you please pull sales data since then, and show how well each product cross-sells from one another?

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE primary_products
SELECT 
	order_id, 
    primary_product_id, 
    created_at AS ordered_at
FROM orders 
WHERE created_at > '2014-12-05' -- when the 4th product was added (says so in question)
;

SELECT
	primary_products.*, 
    order_items.product_id AS cross_sell_product_id
FROM primary_products
	LEFT JOIN order_items 
		ON order_items.order_id = primary_products.order_id
        AND order_items.is_primary_item = 0; -- only bringing in cross-sells;

SELECT 
	primary_product_id, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cross_sell_product_id = 1 THEN order_id ELSE NULL END) AS _xsold_p1,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cross_sell_product_id = 2 THEN order_id ELSE NULL END) AS _xsold_p2,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cross_sell_product_id = 3 THEN order_id ELSE NULL END) AS _xsold_p3,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cross_sell_product_id = 4 THEN order_id ELSE NULL END) AS _xsold_p4,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cross_sell_product_id = 1 THEN order_id ELSE NULL END)/COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS p1_xsell_rt,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cross_sell_product_id = 2 THEN order_id ELSE NULL END)/COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS p2_xsell_rt,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cross_sell_product_id = 3 THEN order_id ELSE NULL END)/COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS p3_xsell_rt,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cross_sell_product_id = 4 THEN order_id ELSE NULL END)/COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS p4_xsell_rt
FROM
(
SELECT
	primary_products.*, 
    order_items.product_id AS cross_sell_product_id
FROM primary_products
	LEFT JOIN order_items 
		ON order_items.order_id = primary_products.order_id
        AND order_items.is_primary_item = 0 -- only bringing in cross-sells
) AS primary_w_cross_sell
GROUP BY 1;
```

QUESTION 8 :- In addition to telling investors about what we’ve already achieved, let’s show them that we still have plenty of gas in the tank. Based on all the analysis you’ve done, could you share some recommendations and  opportunities for us going forward? No right or wrong answer here – I’d just like to hear your perspective!
